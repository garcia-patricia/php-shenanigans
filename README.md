# php-shenanigans
Testing out some PHP stuff (Pulling data, looping and passing ID through links).This is just a personal PHP playground for myself. I would like to integrate the final product in a personal portfolio to make looping through projects easier instead of linking/creating each page seperately.


### Things I would like to accomplish:

* ~~Using PDO~~ and mysqli.  mysqli was used. PDO in a different/smaller project.
* ~~Have pagination (Before/Next/Current) on a page~~ Will attempt in a smaller project.
* ~~Pass ID/Project name through header~~ Projects loop through array and lightbox reflects what image/link was clicked.
