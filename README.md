# php-shenanigans
Testing out some PHP stuff (Pulling data, looping and passing ID through links).This is just a personal PHP playground for myself. I would like to integrate the final product in a personal portfolio to make looping through projects easier instead of linking/creating each page seperately.


### Things I would like to accomplish:

-Using PDO and mysqli
-Pass ID/Project name through header
-Have pagination (Before/Next/Current) on a page
